# OpenGL using GLUT
This repo consists of various exmples of OpenGL collected from various resources.
Thee repo is structured into two directories Primitives and Examples.

* The **Primitves directory** consisits of basic methods and techniques to create shapes or objects:
    * #### Basic Geometry Algorithms:
        * Line drawing Algorithm using DDA and Bresenham
        * Circle drawing Algorithm using Mid-Point theorem and Bresenham 
    * #### Polygon FIlling Algorithms:
        * Flood- Fill
        * Boundary-Fill
    * #### Creating Window 
        Window creation using glut and glfw
    * #### Shaders
        Using vertex and fragment shaders to render triangles.

* The **Example directory** consists of various examples of glut.
    * #### Ex1
        3-D rotating hyperbola
    * #### Ex2
        Analog Clock
    * #### Ex3
        Wireframe planetary revolution
    * #### Ex4
        Changing viewport using keyboard keys. Snow-Man built.
    * #### Ex5
        Rotating triangle
